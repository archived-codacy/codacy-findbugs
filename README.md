# Codacy FindBugs

This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to have [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) support.
You can also create a docker to integrate the tool and language of your choice!
Check the **Docs** section for more information.

## Usage

You can create the docker by doing:

```
sbt docker:publishLocal
```

The docker is ran with the following command:

```
docker run -it -v $srcDir:/src  <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>
```

## Test

We use the [codacy-plugins-test](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-plugins-test) to test our external tools integration.
You can follow the instructions there to make sure your tool is working as expected.
